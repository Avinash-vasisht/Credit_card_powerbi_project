# Credit Card Power BI Project

This project focuses on analyzing credit card transaction data using Power BI. The analysis covers various aspects of credit card usage, revenue generation, and customer behavior. The project involves importing CSV files into SQL, connecting the SQL database to Power BI, and using DAX functions for data analysis. The data model is built with one-to-one relationships, and the visualizations highlight key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Objectives

1. **Identify which card category generates the most revenue.**
2. **Determine where customers most frequently use their cards and the preferred transaction modes.**
3. **Analyze quarterly revenue and gender contributions.**

## Key Insights

1. **Card Category Revenue**
    - **Finding**: The Blue card category generates the most revenue.
    - **Revenue**: 46 million

2. **Customer Usage Patterns**
    - **Finding**: Customers predominantly use their cards for paying bills.
    - **Preferred Mode**: Swipe mode is the most commonly used, followed by chip and online modes.

3. **Quarterly Revenue and Gender Contribution**
    - **Finding**: The second quarter records the highest revenue.
    - **Gender Contribution**: Males contribute the most to the revenue in the second quarter.

## Steps

1. **Import Data into SQL**
    - Import the provided CSV files into an SQL database.
    - Ensure the data is clean and properly formatted for analysis.

2. **Connect SQL to Power BI**
    - Establish a connection between the SQL database and Power BI.
    - Load the data into Power BI for further analysis.

3. **Data Modeling**
    - Create a data model with one-to-one relationships between the relevant tables.

4. **Data Analysis with DAX**
    - Use DAX functions to perform logical and time-based calculations.
    - Examples of DAX functions used include SWITCH, WEEKNUM, etc.

5. **Data Visualization**
    - Create visualizations to represent the key insights.
    - Use charts, graphs, and tables to display the findings.

6. **KPI Establishment**
    - Define and track key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor the performance and trends.
